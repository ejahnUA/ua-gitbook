# Running Your Code

## Overview

All software, including user-generate scripts, should generally be run on *compute nodes* rather than the login nodes.  

> <mark style="color:red;"> *Please do not run anything other than basic file management commands on the login nodes! These are shared between all users and do not have the computing ability to handle resource-intensive jobs. Such jobs will be noticed by our staff and promptly killed without warning.* 

To review the node structure of our system, go [here](url). There are two primary methods to accessing a compute node: GUI and command line. 

1. **GUI** - The HPC GUI can be accessed from a browser at [ood.hpc.arizona.edu](ood.hpc.arizona.edu). More information on this method can be found [here](url)
2. **Command Line** - The traditional method for accessing the HPC is by using the secure shell (SSH) a terminal client application on your local machine. More information on this method can be found [here](url).
